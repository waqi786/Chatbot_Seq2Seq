# Chatbot_Seq2Seq
This repository features a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) chatbot built using TensorFlow and Keras. The chatbot is trained on conversational data to generate responses based on input queries. The model utilizes LSTM layers for both the encoder and decoder to handle the sequential nature of the data.
